# Future Roadmap

## 1.1 Gamification & "Progress Engine"
Project Leveling: Projects (not just users) gain XP. Every 5 days of activity "Levels Up" the project, turning a "Seedling" project into a "Mighty Oak."
The Time Capsule: An automated monthly "Then vs. Now" generator. It pairs the user’s first post with their most recent to visualize 30 days of 5-minute increments.
Consistency Badges: Specialized achievements for specific behavior patterns:
Night Owl: 7 consecutive posts after 10:00 PM UTC.
Weekend Warrior: No misses on Saturdays or Sundays for a month.
The Lifeline: Awarded for being the first "Heart" on 10 new users' posts.

## 1.2 AI-Assisted Inspiration & Smart Prompts
The "Starter Spark": A "Help, I'm Stuck" button that suggests a micro-task based on the project category (e.g., "Just rename one variable" or "Sketch one thumbnail").
The Streak-Saver Prompt: Triggered on the 2nd day of a missed streak (the grace period). It asks for a 1-minute "Thought Post" (no progress required) to keep the streak alive.

## 1.3 The "Ship" Event
The "Ship" Button: A high-visibility post type for completed projects or major milestones.
Featured Status: "Shipped" posts are pinned to the top of the Global Firehose for 24 hours, allowing the entire community to celebrate the "Finish Line."

For the "Ship" button in v2, we should consider allowing users to "Archive" a project once it is shipped. This keeps their profile clean while preserving the history of that specific journey as a "Completed Quest."

## 1.4 Media & Integrations 
Video Support: Short-form (30s) "Work in Progress" clips.
New Platforms: Strava (Fitness), Figma (Design), Duolingo (Language).

# 2. Updated MVP Feature Set
Text & Image Posts (No Video for v1).
GitHub Auto-Tracking (Any commit counts).
Global Firehose with Category Filters (#Coding, #Art, #Writing), with pagination and per-user aggregation so high-activity users don't flood the feed.
The 48-Hour Rule: 2-day grace period before streak reset.
Public Profiles with a "Contribution Map" (visualizing consistency).


# 3. Content & Media
Video Support: Short-form video updates (30-60 seconds) to show "Work in Progress."
Audio Snippets: For musicians or podcasters tracking their daily practice.

# 4. New Integrations
Strava: For fitness-based passion projects.
Figma: Webhooks to detect file updates for designers.
Duolingo/Language Apps: API connections for daily learners.

# 5. Retention & Growth
Nudges: Email or Browser notifications when a user is 4 hours away from a UTC day-reset.

# 6. Projects page on a users profile
Can promote projects to the feed
