# Roadmap

High-level direction for the product. Detailed specs live in [`docs/`](docs/).

---

## Shipped

- **V1** — GitHub sign-in, auto activity from commits, global + per-user feeds. ([V1-SPEC.md](docs/V1-SPEC.md))
- **V2** — Project spaces: multiple projects, repos per project, GitHub App for tracking. ([V2-SPEC.md](docs/V2-SPEC.md))
- **V3 Part A** — Manual text/image posts, unified feed, streaks (48-hour rule, freeze), profile streak dashboard, settings. ([V3-PART-A-SPEC.md](docs/V3-PART-A-SPEC.md))
- **V3 Part B** — Hearts, comments, category filter on feed, post detail thread (`/p/[postId]`), login gateway for guests. ([V3-PART-B-SPEC.md](docs/V3-PART-B-SPEC.md))

---

## Next

- **V4 — Multi-provider auth & Google**  
  Google sign-in alongside GitHub; account linking; same GitHub App flow for repo tracking. Identity (how you log in) stays separate from which repos are connected. ([V4-SPEC.md](docs/V4-SPEC.md))

- **Media** — Short-form video, audio snippets.
